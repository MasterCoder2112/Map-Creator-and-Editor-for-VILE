MAP CREATOR/EDITOR:

WELCOME TO THE APPLICATION THAT ALLOWS YOU TO CREATE/EDIT/SAVE/AND LOAD MAPS THAT CAN BE PLAYED BY MY GAME
SOFTWARE. MOST THINGS ARE SELF EXPLANITORY, BUT A COUPLE THINGS THAT MAY CAUSE CONFUSION. IN TERMS OF THE
MAP BRIGHTNESS, IT IS REFERRING TO RENDER DISTANCE FOR THE MAP IN TERMS OF PIXELS IN THE Z DIRECTION. USUALLY
100,000 IS LIKE REALISTIC FOR BEING OUTSIDE ON A BRIGHT DAY OR SOMETHING. 10000 IS FOR LIKE A DARKER FACILITY,
AND FROM THAT YOU CAN JUST EXPERIMENT AS YOU WANT WITH THAT. FOR THE CUSTOM AUDIO FILE, THE AUDIO FILE MUST BE
AN AUDIO FILE IN YOUR GAMES AUDIO FOLDER, OTHERWISE IT WILL NOT BE ABLE TO LOAD WHEN THE GAME STARTS. DO NOT
END THE NAME WITH .wav THOUGH AS THE GAME TAKES CARE OF THAT FOR YOU. ALSO IN TERMS OF ENTITY ROTATION, 0 IS
THE DIRECTION THAT IS TO THE RIGHT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE MAP USING THIS EDITOR. THIS IS THE POSITIVE Z DIRECTION
IN THE GAME. FROM THERE YOU JUST COUNT THE DEGREES FOR WHERE YOU WANT THE ENTITIES TO FACE. 45 IS 45 DEGREES AND
YOU CAN GO ANYWHERE FROM THERE. IF YOU GO FARTHER THAN 359 IT WILL CORRECT IT ACCORDINGLY TO BE BETWEEN 0 AND
359 DEGREES SO YOU NEED NOT WORRY. AUDIO QUEUE MEANS AUDIO THAT IS PLAYED UPON AN ITEMS ACTIVATION, IT ALSO 
MUST BE A AUDIO FILE WITHIN THE GAMES AUDIO FOLDER. WALLY IS A WALLS DISTANCE ABOVE THE GROUND. DOOR RAISE
HEIGHT IS THE HEIGHT (IF THE ITEM IS A DOOR) THAT THE DOOR WILL BE RAISED.

NEW THINGS WITH THE LATEST VERSION. WALLY, DOOR RAISE HEIGHT, AND AUDIO QUEUE VALUES. AS WELL AS SELECT MODE THAT
ALLOWS YOU TO SEE THE ATTRIBUTES OF A WALL OR ENTITY WITHOUT CHANGING THE CONTENTS OF THE MAP SPACE ITSELF TO SEE
WHAT IT HAS. THIS MAKES IT A LOT EASIER TO DESIGN LEVELS SO YOU ACTUALLY CAN REMEMBER THE ATTRIBUTES OF THE MAP
SPACES BEFORE YOU PLACE NEW THINGS. ALSO THE MAP CREATOR WORKS WITH ALL VERSIONS OF MAPS FROM THE GAME SINCE
ALPHA VERSION 1.4. ANYTHING FROM 1.3 STILL DOES NOT READ CORRECTLY BECAUSE THE ATTRIBUTES ARE LAYED OUT DIFFERENTLY.

TO TRAVERSE THE MAP IN THE MAP CREATOR, USE THE ARROW KEYS ON YOUR KEYBOARD OR THE BUTTONS. SLIDERS WILL COME LATER.
